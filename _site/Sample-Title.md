# Bio

Hi, I'm me. This is a shared bio that all of the books can reference. This is handy if you manage a lot of books like I do and you want to be able to quickly update the bio page for all of them.

Just update this file, rebuild, and all of your books that include the `bio.md` file will have an updated bio page.
