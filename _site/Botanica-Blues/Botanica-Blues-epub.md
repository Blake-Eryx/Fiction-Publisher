# Botanica Blues 

‘Puerto Rico, my heart’s devotion, let it sink back in the ocean!’ Rita Moreno sings on the television and I smirk, picking up my glass of soda. The sides are slick with moisture and the damn thing slips out of my hands, spilling ice and soda everywhere.
 
“Shit,” I say, vaulting myself out of my chair and standing over the growing puddle, hands up in surrender and helplessness even though its only a spill. Just a spill of soda and my brain freezes for a minute, the television playing the Bernstein tune in the background. Before I can do anything, my grandmother pops her head out of the kitchen to see what I’m cursing about.
 
“_¿Que pasó?_” she asks me. She has a wet dishrag in her hand already, her tiny frame hobbling towards me.
 
“Just the damn soda,” I say. “I can do it, _abuela_,” but she’s already on her hands and knees cleaning it. I’m about to bend down to help when my phone chimes. It’s work.
 
“Go, go get it,” she scolds, getting up to wring out the rag in the kitchen. I can’t say no to her, and I can’t ignore the text. I make a sound that’s supposed to mean ‘I surrender’ and wrestle with my jacket, pulling out my phone and sliding my finger across its screen to read the message.
 
`<605 Avenue B/12/1-26>`
 
I curse under my breath and my grandmother doesn’t even say anything as I grab my gun and my bag, pulling them both on as I go to head out the door. “I’ll make you a plate!” she calls after me. _“Señor te bendiga!”_
 
I don’t let her see me cringe. I head out the metal door, careful to pull it all the way closed, leaving it up to her to lock the damn thing. She’s lived in this apartment fifty-two years and the door still sticks. A metal door. Damn project housing.
 
I hear the three locks snap closed as I head towards the staircase. _Señor te bendiga_ and lock all the doors. Right.
 
 
 
\  



 
I get there in seven minutes and cops are already on the scene, yellow tape drawing gawking stares from people in the neighborhood. I flash my badge at the officer watching the perimeter and he lets me pass through. Hunts saw me park my car, I know he has and he nods at me as I fall in step with him into the building. The cops outside, their faces are white as ghosts. Twelve is a big number. Hunts seems a bit unsteady himself. He hands me a mask.
 
As soon as my feet hit the steps heading down into the basement I smell it. Stale incense and blood. The rot of bodies. Herbs. An extinguished fire. The odors make their way through the mask and into my memory. I know these aromas and I smell them here, their scent growing stronger as we descend. No one hung any lights in the staircase but I can see the light growing at the bottom of the landing, where the reek is coming from. Light and the terrible stench. Rotting meat and thick resins, so thick you want to scrub the inside of your head to get the stink out but you can’t think of cleaner strong enough.
 
Only a handful of cops are down here, looking over the piles of meat, bone and organs. That’s all they are for now, till Forensics can ID them. Even after that, they’ll only be people in the memories of those still around. That’s all you get, if you’re lucky. But my musings are slapped out of my head when I see the walls. The closest body makes my stomach turn in a way it hasn’t in a while.
 
The walls are painted in dried, brown blood. Giant eyes all around. They all stare down at the bodies. And the bodies…where the top of the head should be, there isn’t one. The eyes are wide with terror, the mouth stretched in a soundless scream but what poured out had apparently been brain matter. Shards of skull litter the floor. I put my hand over my mouth. I can’t help it.
 
“No signs of powder or incendiary devices, before you ask.” Yang stands up. Her hands are wrapped in stained, blue latex gloves. She talks through her mask. How she can breathe so close to these bodies, I don’t know. “Except for the candles, but they hardly count. I’d put the time of death at three days ago, sometime between midnight and three in the morning.” She points at the piles of remains as she speaks, and I can’t help but stare at the maroon splattered on the bright blue. “Five females, seven males, all between the ages of nineteen to late 40s, I’d say. One even went to your alma mater.” She holds up a student identification card. NCU. It’s the nineteen year old. The picture is of a sullen undergrad, dyed hair, dark circles under her eyes. Pretty. I probably would have asked her out if we were classmates. Hell, I might have asked her out today, if she were alive.
 
“I’ll have fun looking through the yearbook,” I say. It’s a dumb joke, I know but sometimes dumb jokes are all I got. Yang manages a smile and Hunts crosses his arms across his chest. “What about the candles?” Start off easy, before I have to look at the gruesome stuff, shove my face into it.
 
“A little gift left by whoever did this,” Hunts says, walking over to one corner of the room. There’s actually a trash can in this part of the room, a small one. The contents have been laid out across the ground, strewn methodically, tagged and bagged. Hunts picks one up and hands it to me.
 
_Botanica de los Fondos_. I know the place. They close at eight, so I’ve got time. I nod and put it in my bag, and one of the other officers call Hunts over so he excuses himself.
 
Now’s the time to put my face in it. I pull out my pad and pencil and I walk around, careful not to step in any of the crusted smears on the floor. It’s a new pad, spiral bound. I stand in front of one of the eyes and I draw it. Some people would just take a picture and I’ll take a picture too but for me drawing gives it more meaning. I’m not the best artist but I’m okay. I practice by trying to copy pictures. It’s all just lines. Straight lines, curved lines, lines making no sense. Beginnings and endings. I draw the eye from the wall drawn in blood. I wonder where the blood came from. Yang’s crew will be able to tell me later.
 
I draw the eye with thick lines. Thick strokes, back and forth, sloppy. There are spatters of blood on the wall. I draw a few dots. Lines and dots. Pulling out my phone I take a few pictures.
 
I turn around and take in the scene. I count the steps between the bodies and draw the rough circle. I look at the candles and sketch them in. Limbs become crooked lines, blown open heads interrupted circles, pools of gore curves with no logic. I look over the clothes. Brown robes. No jewelry.
 
The lines on the floor and the circles I draw next. I turn the page and the sound makes people look toward me. They can fuck themselves. Symbols are written and I write them as carefully as I can, inspecting each one. I pull my phone out to take another pic and I’ve got a message.
 
`<Frankies Bday this Sunday. You comin?>`
 
I blow out my cheeks and dismiss it, turning on the camera again. A few pushes on the screen. Twenty new pics added to the gallery. The symbols seem familiar but don’t place with anything I’ve come across recently, nothing I’ve studied. But it’s obvious from the scene the person I’m dealing with is one of the bad ones.
 
“Quintana, you heading out?” I just close my notebook and shove it into my bag when Yang waves me over. I step toward her, trying to ignore the stains on the floor but avoid them at the same time. It’s hard. My stomach hurts. But she pulls back the sleeve of one of the bodies.
 
A tattoo. I pull out my notebook to sketch it and she laughs. She’s got a nice laugh, Yang. She doesn’t laugh enough. “Just take a pic and be done with it,” she said.
 
“Drawing it makes it stick more,” I say. Another circle in a circle. Looks like a stylized skull to me, but not one I’ve seen before. “When you ID them, send me the info,” I say, pulling out the phone. I snap a picture of it and put my notebook away. “I’m heading out to check on some people before I head back to the office.”
 
“We know how to get a hold of you,” Yang says. I lower my head and wave goodbye to Hunts before I make my way up the stairs, the mixture of fresh and fetid air reigniting the stink in my nose. It’s disgusting. If hell is real and smells like something, it’d be pretty damn close to this.
 
 
 
\  



 
The _botanica_ is only a few blocks away so I don’t bother driving. I’m not going to risk not finding a parking spot. The stink of the scene is still in my nose and I spit to the side to try and dislodge it. An old woman comes out of the _botanica_, pushing a wire shopping cart. I hold the door open for her and she smiles warmly at me. Her face is all wrinkles and she grins at me toothlessly, thanking me in Spanish. I just smile back and duck into the store.
 
The owner of the store comes out of the back holding a box in his hands. He’s dressed all in white and doesn’t look like the kind of guy who would own a shop like this. Rows of candles, herbs, statues of saints. It smells like incense in here. Danny is a young guy, not even thirty years old. Good looking, more Taino blood than Spanish. Curly dark hair. Used to sell drugs but never got busted for it. Something happened and he took up Santeria and working with his uncle. His uncle was killed about a year ago and I helped clear Danny and his practice of the charges. He and his uncle were some of the good people. I didn’t give a shit if they killed animals from time to time. They turned a coke dealer into one of the model citizens in the neighborhood.
 
Danny looks happy to see me and he puts the box on the counter. Some music plays in the background, some old salsa music. “Luis,” he says. “What brings you here?” He’s calm and goes to the little fridge he keeps behind the counter and pulls out one of those cheap sodas, coconut flavor. “You need a drink?”
 
“Business, not pleasure, Danny,” I say. It comes out grim. Danny twists the cap off the soda and gives me a strange look.
 
“What’s up?” he asks me and I pull out the receipt. It’s still in the plastic bag and I place it on the counter. The door opens and a different little old lady walks in. Danny waves at her before he looks over the receipt. He gulps. I see it.
 
“You know who bought this?” I ask. “A few days ago? I know you got cameras in here.” I point to the corners of the shop and wave into one of them. “This person a regular?”
 
“No,” Danny says quickly. I can tell he knows the guy and he looks worried. Thinking back to the bodies in the room, I’m not surprised. “I don’t usually deal with this guy. He paid cash, before you ask.”
 
“But you know him,” I say, stating the obvious. “I can’t tell you what he did but I can say, it was very, very bad. I don’t want him doing it again. I don’t think you would want him to do it either.”
 
Danny just shook his head. “He’s not a _santero_,” he insisted, pulling out a video tape from under the counter. He slides it over to me. “He’s not from this neighborhood. He’s from the Upper East Side.”
 
“Why’s he coming down here to cause trouble?” I ask. Danny just shrugs. “What’d you sell him?”
 
“Just a few candles. Black and green and red. He came in around closing time.” Danny takes a sip of his soda and his hands are shaking. “Is everything okay?”
 
“I’m going to try to make things better.” It’s the truth. “Do you know his name?”
 
Danny can only shake his head and he sets the soda on the counter. “No. But people call him _El Maboyero._”
 
_El Maboyero._ I look at Danny and I can’t help but feel it’s a bit theatrical. Come on. “You guys need to chill out with this,” is the advice I give him. “Can I call you if I have any questions?”
 
“Yeah, definitely,” he says. “Just,” He’s nervous, still. “Be careful.”
 
“Right,” I say. I put the tape in my bag and I walk toward the door. The eyes of the saints follow me on the way out, or at least they seem to. They’re just plaster and paint after all.
 
“I’ll keep you in my prayers,” he calls after me. I cringe but I don’t let him see before I head out the door.
 
 
 
\  



 
We sat outside. It was hot and if there’s a hell and it’s sandy, it’s probably based on something like this. I was playing cards with Martin. Jackass from New Jersey. Always have a battle buddy and Martin was good enough. He liked Kung Fu movies. Like me, Martin had joined the Army after 9/11. I was in my sophomore year of college when it had happened, he was a freshman. A bunch of young guys who wanted to protect our country. By sweating in another one. Martin was so shitty at cards.
 
I was dealing a hand when someone shouted. We looked up and then the noises started. Not noises. Gun shots. Everyone started cursing and running around. Who the fuck was supposed to be on guard duty? I was just an Intel guy, writing reports, looking at the information. Bullets were flying. Where the fuck is my rifle?
 
Martin handed me my weapon and I remember thinking _Shit, when did it get so fucking dark?_ Even darker were the figures in the distance. Their eyes glowed.
 
Pain overtook my brain, more than the fear and the shouting. I passed out.
 
 
 
\  



 
The guy on the tape is tall, dark hair. He looks like one of those kids who hangs out on St. Antony’s Place too much. He’s got a tattoo on the inside of his wrist, like the girl. I can’t tell if it’s the same tattoo though. I’ll give it to the tech guys to clean up. I’ve got a report in my in-box.
 
It lists the victims. Over half of them have been identified. Three of them are missing people; from New England. Fuck.
 
My phone beeps and I swipe my finger across it. Another text.
 
`<U comin on Sunday? Frankie wants to see his tío.>`
 
I sigh. Sunday’s four days from now. I type, ‘Sorry, busy with case. Wouldn’t miss it. What does he want?’ I think about the girl with the tattoo. I’ll just head to the school library, find her in a yearbook. See what clubs she’s in. NCU doesn’t have yearbooks online yet. She and _El Maboyero_ look the same age. Maybe they were a little more than whatever it was they were.
 
My phone beeps again.
 
`<Hes really into skyriders.>`
 
What the fuck is that?? I type back. I hit send and the phone rings. It scares the shit out of me and I jump, feeling my heart thump in my chest when I answer it. “Quintana here.”
 
“Quintana, did you get the report?” It’s Yang. I turn in my seat, looking it over and nod though she can’t see me.
 
“Yeah, I got it.” My stomach grumbles. After the scene I didn’t have an appetite and now I’m hungry. I know my grandma has a plate of food for me waiting at home but I could grab something in the Village. “Any lead on the cause of the…uh…”
 
“The brains exploding?” Yang suggests. “No. The only thing that could liquefy the brain would be Ebola but it doesn’t cause damage to the skull like that. Plus, no cases have been found in the US. All the victims suffered severe head trauma from within the cranium itself.” I heard her whistle. “It’s a real head scratcher, for lack of a better term.”
 
“I’m sure there’s a reason for it. Maybe some kind of gas or drug was used in the initiation. Did the tox screens come back with anything?”
 
“Nothing.”
 
“Anything in common?”
 
“They were all born in Puerto Rico,” she said. “The most recently relocated was a man, Emanuel Cordova-Colón, two weeks ago.”
 
“Any more of them have tattoos?” I ask, looking at the video. If there’s some weird cult thing going on, I need to figure it out. That’s my job. What the cult is, who the leader is, their practices, what they are capable of. I was pretty sure I knew the leader. But what the hell was this? And how do I stop them from doing this again?
 
“Did you even read the report?” she asks me. I grin.
 
“You called right when I was about to start it,” I confess. No need to lie. “You sound tired, Yang. When was the last time you took a vacation?”
 
“I’m going to California in two weeks for a family reunion,” she offers. She doesn’t sound relieved. Being surrounded by family isn’t exactly a break. “San Francisco. My sister just had a baby.”
 
“Boy or a girl?” I ask, looking over the report. All born in Puerto Rico, though not in the same towns. One of them had a birthday two days ago. Happy birthday.
 
“Girl. My mother is furious.” Yang sighs. “Hey, I got a guy here, I have to go. I’ll let you know if I find anything else.”
 
“Sounds good,” I say and she hangs up. I check the text from my sister.
 
`<A video game.>`
 
I roll my eyes. Frankie has too many video games. I’ll get him something else. I’ll order something online, I have the two-day shipping.
 
Time to hit the library.
 
* * *
 
The library of New City University isn’t the same as when I attended. They moved it when they brought all the branches together. It confuses the shit out of me but I find it after I ask the security guard. It’s below ground, where the old language building used to be. I studied Greek here.
 
The librarian is some work-study kid today. Short dark hair, thick glasses, pierced lip. I don’t have time to fuck around so I just ask her where the yearbooks are. She points them out and gives me a smile. I must look like I could use one. She has a nice smile. Her tag says her name is “River.” I find the yearbooks and look for the most recent one. They’re a lot nicer than when I attended. I flip to the index. Montalvo, Gina. That’s the girl. She’s on a few pages. First picture of her is on page twenty-three.
 
I guess that’s what she looks like with the top of her head on. Dyed hair, too much make up. Wearing black. I look at the next page. Club photos. Urban Landscaping and Repurposing. Science Fiction Club. Spanish Club.
 
Shit.
 
It’s the guy from the video.
 
James Hernandez. He’s in the Urban Landscaping picture and the Spanish Club. 
 
I flip to the back of the yearbook and look him up. Hernandez, James. He’s in a few pics. Upperclassman. James is in a film club, a political club. He makes Gina look like a lollipop princess. His hair appears greasy and his mouth like it hasn’t smiled in a long time. He looks angry. He looks familiar.
 
I pull out my phone and look around to make sure I’m not bothering anybody. I text Hunts.
 
`<Incoming info. Positive ID on candle buyer. Connected to one of the victims.>`
 
I snap a few pictures from the yearbook and save them, highlighting the two faces and the names before I save them. I fire off a quick email to Hunts and attach the photos.
 
I missed a call from my grandmother. I know she didn’t leave a message. That’s not how she is.
 
I put the yearbook away and go back to the front desk. River’s still there, reading something. I pull out my badge. It’s gotta be done.
 
“Hey, I was wondering if you could pull up the records on any books a Gina Montalvo or a James Hernandez might have borrowed?”
 
For a second I think she’s not going to help me out. If she’s a good NCU kid, she won’t trust cops.
 
“I’m not a cop,” I explain. “I’m a private investigator.”
 
“But you work with the cops,” she says and her eyes narrow at me. On cue.
 
“I work on special cases that have to do with abuses of religion,” I say. “And I don’t let people just trying to do their thing get lumped in with the crazies. I’m an alum,” I say. “Majored in Religious Studies.”
 
“Are these guys alright?” she asks. Her hands are already on the keyboard. I shrug. I’m not about to tell her the girl’s head is no more and the guy’s on the loose. 
 
“They’re in a bit of trouble and I’m trying to help them out.” That’s the truth. 
 
She clicks around a little bit and a page prints out. River hands it to me and I thank her, walking over to one of the tables. Let’s see what we got.
 
The Complete Works of Johann Most.
 
The Necronomicon.
 
Hymns to the Great Old Ones.
 
Art of Ancient Mesopotamia.
 
A few others. Art books, anarchy, myths. 
 
My phone blinks. I have a message. I walk towards where the first book is supposed to be on the shelf and check out what it says.
 
`<Garrett has a hold. On Hernandez. Clock’s ticking.>`
 
I curse under my breath. Garrett. He’s the city official pushing for a tighter hold on the religious communities, for more regulation and less freedom. He’s a dickhead. As soon as he’s got all the details, he’ll pin it on someone and propose a law that’ll put out the candles on altars from here to the Sound. 
 
Most of these guys are good guys, whether they follow Ellegua or Zeus. I don’t know what comes first. Is the person good, so they find the set of rules that fits best? Or do the rules make them good people? I pull a book off the shelf. It’s old as NCU itself, older. I go to find the next book. My phone blinks again.
 
`<Hernandez. 445 168th St. No suspect.>`
 
I find the next book. A few of them are still checked out. They make a nice ‘thud’ as I set them on the table and sit down.
 
`<Be there ASAP>` I text to Hunts and  open the page to the hymn book. My blood goes cold.
 
I pull out my sketchbook and flip it open. The eyes are there. The shapes of the bodies are there. The circles. The symbols. 
 
What the fuck? I’ve got my religious connection. I turn the page and the paper is brittle. I’m worried the book might fall apart right there on the table.
 
The book isn’t going to fall apart.
 
I might.
 
 
 
\  



 
Ropes ate into my wrists and ankles and my head hurt. Not on one side, like it does when someone hits you in the head. Deep, at the core radiating out. It was hot. I didn’t know where my shirt was. 
 
Martin sat tied up beside me. He was also naked from the waist up. He didn’t look hurt but he was moaning. Moaning. And they were chanting.
 
It was hot. Hot like always but it hurt. Like the air grated against my skin. The chanting. All I could think was, _this is it._ The terrorists. They got us. My _abuela_ is going learn about this on CNN. I wanted to cry. Martin was moaning and they were chanting. I looked up to see who had attacked our base.
 
This.
 
These were not the people I learned about in training.
 
These were…my head throbbed as I looked them over and my eyes watered. 
 
They danced naked in the hellish heat. Their eyes were…their skin…I didn’t want to look. I pulled my eyes away but even with my eyes screwed shut I saw them. It was the chanting. The terrible chanting. It wasn’t Arabic or Persian. I tried to tell myself it was a dialect of whatever terrible tribe this was but something laughed at me and forced my mind over the details of the scene. The terrible syllables. The naked skin. The wild gyrations. The scrawls on the wall. I tried to think about other things, I tried to focus. My baby cousin’s face, the sound of music on the radio, the kiss of my last girlfriend. The ropes scraped my wrists. A drum thudded again and again, erratically. I felt my heart in my chest, trying to keep time with it and sweat pouring like blood down my brow.
 
Martin was crying. His sobs were the only thing making sense. I hated hearing him but I needed him to keep crying. I heard him try to speak. I thought he was praying but I listened closely and he was saying the name of his wife and kid. My chest felt tight. He repeated them over and over like a mantra, till they lost their definition and became a phrase said over and over, punctuated with sobbing. I looked up at the sky.
 
My mouth fell open. 
 
I had spent a lot of time staring up at the stars here, looking at the constellations. 
 
These weren’t right. 
 
Not just the constellations. I tried to tell myself they could have moved us so far, the sky was different but the fact chewed at my brain, devouring facts and leaving me with this. Stars glowing too bright in all the wrong places. And a dark gash across the sky, jagged. Like a mouthful of broken teeth, ripped across the sky in ebony. And the chanting. It sounded like terrible chewing. 
 
Chewing and crying. Chaos.
 
One of the cultists came over and spit something in Martin’s face. I looked away. I couldn’t be there, wherever I was. It couldn’t be Earth. Martin shrieked. I wanted him to keep it together, I wanted to say something but I didn’t.
 
I felt afraid.
 
And then the orderly sound of machine gun fire, rattling off stone. The squelch of bullets into flesh and the crunch of bone were lost to the rest of us, swallowed by the order of battle. The drills. How to hold your weapon, colliding against the disorganization of emotions, of the adrenaline of liquid fear and liquid bravery excreted by your guts. I closed my eyes. I heard people shouting in Arabic. 
 
The next thing I knew I was lying in a hospital bed. IV bag, bandages. A psychiatrist came a few times to ask me what happened. They thought I didn’t know he was a psychiatrist but I knew. I told him some terrorists got us, held us hostage. That was it. He asked me a few times. He asked me why I couldn’t sleep at night. He asked what I screamed about in the night. I said it was PTSD. 
 
I asked about Martin. He wasn’t in the recovery room with me. A nurse told me he was sent back to the States. His wife sent me a letter, checking on me, asking me what happened. She told me Martin was in a mental hospital. I never wrote her back.
 
I was discharged from the Army. Went back to school. I busted my ass. Kept busy. Majored in theology with a concentration in indigenous religions, minored in criminology. My grandma asked if I was going to be a pastor. I would kiss her on forehead and shake my head and say no.

“You okay, Luis?” Yang slurps her noodles. It’s the way you’re supposed to eat them. I’m still wondering why she came out with me. Maybe she heard something in my voice when she called. I had just got the text from Hunt, pulling into traffic. I almost threw the phone out the damn window after I read it. I wasn’t needed anymore. What they found it Hernandez’ apartment made this a terrorist ordeal, not a religious one. The Mayor was holding a press conference about it. I didn’t bother to catch it but I know what he said, that smug asshole. More political rhetoric. More bullshit and lies for everyone. I poke at my bowl with my chopsticks. I want to cry, actually. Something about all this. The stress. How close. I feel raw. 
 
I shrug and poke, stirring. Yang slurps her soup. “I know you must be pissed. It’s not Hunts’ call. But you know how shit is since 9/11. They get a whiff of terrorism, they don’t care about particulars.”
 
It makes my throat tighten up to hear it. It’s bigger than that but countering terrorism wins elections, it’s what people understand. My soup smells good but I don’t care. “It’s bigger than terrorism,” I say. My jaw hurts, I’ve been clenching it so tight. “It’s bigger. It’s more terrifying than people hating us or what we have. It’s makes….” I can’t even talk. I put my face in my hands and rub. I need a shave, I need a shower. I need to eat but I’ve got no appetite. I feel sick. 
 
“I’d ask if you told Hunts this but I know the answer,” Yang said. She reaches across the small table with her chopsticks, putting dumplings on her plate. Yang can eat. It’s one of the reasons I like her but right now all I can think about is how much of a lunatic I must seem to her.
 
“I told him, I told him,” I said. “But it doesn’t matter what I say, Garrett’s got an agenda and they don’t believe me.”
 
“Maybe you should join the force officially, you know?” Yang says. I shake my head and roll my eyes. We’ve had this talk before.
 
“I don’t want to do all that bullshit paperwork and jump through their hoops and their games, Angie. Fuck, I want to help people out and all they want to do play their stupid games. Twelve people are dead, one person is responsible and they’re more interested in tying it to al-fucking-Qaeda for a quick nod in the polls than knowing what’s really going on.”
 
“Terrorism isn’t a game, Lou.”
 
“In comparison it’s a fucking joke. You weren’t there.” I stop talking. I stop yelling. It’s quiet in the restaurant. Everyone is looking at me, I know it. Yang is staring at me. She puts some money on the table, more than what the food is worth and she grabs me by the arm and pulls me out of the restaurant, gingerly. I let her. I don’t want to be there anymore anyway.
 
We get outside and it’s hot and humid. Storm clouds are rumbling on the other side of the river.  I can hear them. I wonder what it would be like to get hit by lightening, right there. Yang looks me over, like a patient, like one of her cadavers. “Luis, what’s going on? What’s going on with you?”
 
I throw my hands in the air and I pace the block. It’s late so no one is around. Just the people in the noodle shop and a few cars passing by. “I know what’s going on, Angie, I’ve seen it before. I know what they were doing or I’ve got an idea. I saw it when I was in the service.”
 
“You…” Yang looks at me like I’m growing a horn out the middle of my head. “What?” 
 
“I’ve seen it. I know who it is, what they’re doing, what they think they’re doing. It’s not terrorists, not that kind. It’s terror but not the kind that comes from being shot in your bed or blown up when you go out for coffee. That might send you home, might get you off the sidewalks. No, this is real terror. This is the sky trying to take a bite out of your mind. It gets you off the streets and crying in your room, in the dark and it follows you there. You can’t ignore it. You can’t forget it. You can’t shoot it. It…” I don’t have any words left. Angie looks afraid. The thunder rumbles.
 
“Look…I…I think I got too close on this case,” I manage. I think of Martin. I wonder what he would say if I showed him the books. 
 
“I think maybe…yeah.” She goes into her pocket and pulls out her wallet. It has flowers on it, pink and black. She pulls out a card and hands it to me. “Look, Luis, you’re a good investigator. We need people like you. Maybe you should…see someone.” I take the card from here. A name is on it. Someone with a Ph.D. A therapist. “You have to help yourself before you can help others.”
 
I look at the card long enough so that she thinks I’ll call the guy and I put it in my front pocket. “Okay,” I say. Okay to what, I don’t know. “Okay.” I say it again. I can’t look at her anymore. I feel like an asshole for blowing up like that. Like a fool for telling her so much. And afraid because of what I said and how I know it’s true. I think about the twelve bodies in the room and the hot sand in the Middle East. I think about the sky and its terrible bite.
 
“Let me get you a cab,” she says and before I can protest she hails one and stuffs me inside. I lean back in the seat, tired. She waves to me and I nod before I give the cabbie the address, not bothering to buckle my seat belt before he speeds away.
 
I don’t go home, not right away. I get to Danny’s _botanica_ right as he’s about to turn the sign. He looks happy to see me. He opens the door, still dressed in white. “I thought you might show up.”
 
“You did?” I step inside and smell the familiar aromas. Thunder rumbles behind me and he closes the door, flipping the sign and locking the door for now. 
 
“Yeah. I saw the news.”
 
“Oh.” I feel the smile fall off my face. “Dan, I tried, man, I really did.”
 
“I know.” He shrugs, arranging some of the statues on the shelf. “Tied it to Puerto Rican nationalists working with underground terrorist cells.”
 
I wince. Why Garrett went with that, I don’t know. 
 
“The news was crazy about it. You should have seen the guy’s room.” Danny goes behind the counter and opens the fridge, pulling out two sodas. He hands me one and twists his open, the fizz of the carbonation loud in the quiet store. “That guy was into some crazy shit.”
 
“I know,” I say. I know. I don’t know if Danny really knows. I know Garrett and Hunt don’t really know. It gives me a chill. “But hey, you’re off the hook.” It’s the only thing I can offer to lighten the mood.
 
“For now,” he said. He smiles and takes a swig of his soda. “You should go home though, Luis, _Hermana_ Avila was here looking for you earlier.”
 
“My grandma?” I whistle. My grandma doesn’t approve of me helping the religious minorities. She thinks they’re evil. She’s an old lady though so I assure her I’ll be safe and go on my way. She must have really wanted to find me. “Yeah, it’s late. I just wanted to stop by and tell you I’m off the case. Now that it’s not a religious matter.”
 
“Yeah. I figured.” He takes another sip of his soda and laughed. “Next time, right?” 
 
I laugh and walked towards the door, hearing him snap the lights off behind me. “Yeah, next time. See you, Danny.” I let myself out and crack open the soda, hearing the rumble of thunder and the clatter of the metal shade of Danny store being pulled down. 
 
I get home and my grandma is already asleep. There’s a plate of food in the oven so I finish it off in front of the TV with my soda, the television turned low so I don’t wake her up. Some cartoons are on, stupid ones. I watch them anyway. I could do with something stupid.
 
My phone beeps. I know who it is before I even pull it out.
 
`<You get home ok?>`
 
`<Mugged by feral hobos on St. Antony’s>` I type. I smear grease on the screen. I don’t care, I laugh at my own stupid joke.
 
`<Haha. Take care. Call if you need anything.>`
 
`<Thx>` I type. I add `<Goodnight>` before I hit send and set the phone on the table. I don’t feel like lying in my bed so I put my plate in the kitchen and curl back up in the chair. I watch stupid cartoons until I fall asleep. Something about some kids making stupid videos and octopuses.

“Happy Birthday, Francisco,” I say, handing him a card. He’s just a kid so he’s probably wondering where the present is. I smile apologetically as he frowns, opening the card. He smiles when he sees the gift card inside. $50. Not a bad haul when you’re nine. 
 
My sister’s got the AC pumped up too high so when I sit on the couch it feels cold and uncomfortable. I cringe as I settle into the leather cushions, holding my beer. The food smells good and my sisters’ kids are all running around and whooping and carrying on while some of the older kids play some video game on the TV. I’m not into video games. I gave one of these kids a book for their last birthday and they looked at me like I was fucking nuts. Damn kids. 
 
“When is _abuela_ going to be here, Luis?” my sister asks.
 
“I don’t know, Hilda,” I say, exasperated after the fifth time. 
 
“I don’t know why you didn’t bring her with you,” Merna says. She’s eating a plate of food, her huge belly looking like it might pop at any moment. She’s on her fourth kid and her third plate. 
 
“Because I wasn’t going to take her to see a dead body on the way, jeez.” I got a call to consult on a pair of bodies found in East Park. Ritual suicide. Great way to start the morning. I take a sip of my beer. “She said she would be fine taking the train. She’s been taking the public transportation longer than you’ve been alive.”
 
“It’s faster to take the train than to drive,” Gilbert says. He’s my cousin. I point to him. At least he has some sense.
 
“I heard that new building on 23rd and Riverside is taking housing applications,” Merna says, finishing her plate. Not this again. 
 
“Hey, when’s the cake going to be here?” I yell towards the kitchen. 
 
“Nando is bringing it from the bakery, he should be back soon!” Delia comes out of the kitchen, smiling. My favorite sister. I’m allowed to have a favorite. Especially when the other two are so damn annoying. At least they’re not asking me if I’m dating anyone anymore.
 
Something rumbles off in the distance and for a moment I think it’s more thunder, another summer storm rolling in. But this rumble isn’t the same. It’s more than the sky. I swear I feel the building shake. An earthquake? I look at my family members and all of us look at each other, not saying anything. I walk over and look out the window.
 
My phone shakes and I pull it out while staring, sliding my finger across the screen and finally look at the message. It’s from Yang.
 
`<Turn on the news>`
 
“Turn on the news,” I croak, staring out the at scene. To the south I see it. A cloud. Black and brown, still surging in the hot, thick summer air. The windows are already closed but I can see the trees whipping around. The sky is green like an old bruise, sick and twisted. The clouds are simmering in the sky and I hear my sisters shouting at the kids to turn off the damn video game, shouting for the remote. Then they gasp. I know what’s on the television. I don’t want to see it. But I turn and walk over.
 
It’s the news. They’re reporting an explosion in downtown, massive. A huge storm is making it difficult for any helicopters to get in but the crater is estimated to have a two to three block radius. The power station by the Drive is on fire. I see flames dancing in the background. Steam rises off the ground. The reporter chokes and a wind whips across him, making him fall to the side. 
 
“_Abuela_,” Delia gasps. I grab my jacket and I don’t listen to their encouragements or protests. I leave the apartment, the metal door closing with a slam behind me. I think I tell them all to stay put.
 
The lights in the building flicker three times and then die, another rumble from outside laughing at the darkness within the building. I take the stairs, wishing I had my flashlight. People are standing in their doorways. I flash my badge at them. “Stay inside,” I order them. They don’t know it’s not a police badge. I’m just a private investigator but they can’t see in the dark and the doors close and slam. I hear their locks click shut. Stay inside, I tell myself but I can’t.
 
It’s hot outside and if hell has a sky it looks like this. Green and surging with clouds of black and gray. The wind is whipping around, the trees lining the street shaking and I hear a branch cracking. I watch the sky as I run to my car, other people staring up at the sky too, mouths hanging open, gasping, crying, praying. 
 
I see it. The hole in the sky. Like a wicked smile. The clouds boil over it, obscuring it but I can see it. I know it’s there. I know what Hernandez did, how he set the load and the fuel in that basement with the twelve and then had the fuse somewhere else. And it blew. The ritual set the keg and he lit the thing to blow before the cops took him in. I know that now, now that the keg has blown. I didn’t know it yesterday when I was too pissed off from being kicked off the team, or yelling at Yang or talking to Danny. Danny. Fuck, Danny. He’s probably dead. I pull open the door of my car, opening my glove compartment. My gun spills out onto the floor and I pick it up and put it in the seat. 
 
The clouds still billow up ahead and I pull out, a passing car almost sideswiping me as I back out. I curse at the car and pull into the street. My hands are shaking on the wheel. My grandma probably left before this all happened. She might be trapped in a subway tunnel but that’s it. She’s probably alive. Danny, maybe he went to go visit his uncle’s grave today. Maybe. I drive with one hand as I fish for my phone with the other, scrolling through the numbers. I call Dan’s cell and get an automated voice. No connection. I growl at the phone and try Yang. Same thing. My grandma doesn’t even have a cell phone so I throw the phone to the floor of the car, not bothering to signal before I turn on the street.
 
I hit my steering wheel with both hands and curse. People are just parked in the street, standing outside, mouths open, stupid. Mesmerized by the cloud and the sky. I can’t be the only one who sees it, right? I roll down my window. “Get in your fucking cars and move!” I scream. I honk my horn. “Move, you stupid fucks!” I turn and see a Catholic priest, staring at me from the sidewalk. I yell at him. “Make them move, damn you!” He looks at me sadly. I groan at him and roll up my window.
 
I can’t be the only one who sees it. That has to be why they’re all staring, at the crack in the sky, the mouth. They all have to hear it. The wind is its terrible breathing, erratic and hot. The stench is from the sky, not the smoke. It’s not burning debris and bodies, it’s the reek of a place within, a place that is terrible and chews with broken teeth, with blazing hot stars. I lay down across my seat. They have to see it. I think of Martin, I see the hole in the sky. I find my gun in my hands. Cold and hard, mechanic. Ordered.
 
Through the windows of my car, pressing through the glass I hear the pandemonium. People are screaming. I hear them. Some are calling out. It’s only adding to the chaos. I hate it. I can see people walking past my car. Out the windshield I see the cloud, still steadily rising. The mouth is leering at me. 
 
The gun is in my hands. I pull back the hammer. 
 
I see my phone. I consider texting Yang or someone but what would I write? 
 
I tumble off the seat as something hits my car hard from behind, tossing me forward onto the floor. Something slides out from under the seat. It’s the library books.
 
I’m the only one who has these books in the city. I know what’s going on. I know. 
 
The gun is hot in my hand now. The pages fall open. Someone is banging on my car door in a way that makes no sense. The symbols with their strange geometry at the bottom of my car. 
 
My phone starts to ring. It’s face down so I can’t see who it is. Someone is screaming through the window.
 
The cruel smile in the sky is laughing now, the smoke plume rising up into it. The wind mixes with screams.
 
The phone rings again.
 
Fists beat on my windows. Sirens shriek in the distance.
 
The page lies open.
 
Chaos.
 
I bring the gun to my head.
 
The symbols are there. Burned into the land.
 
The mouth in the sky gapes wider, devouring its sacrificial smoke.
 
The people are crying. Martin’s words ring in my ears.
 
I put my finger on the trigger.
 
I see the face of the priest in the window. 
 
The symbol on the page is there.
 
Chaos.
 
I squeeze the trigger.
