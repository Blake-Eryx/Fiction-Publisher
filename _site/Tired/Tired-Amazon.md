# Tired
Be careful what you wish for others.
 
Before the Red Brother found the First City. Before Miz was summoned from the sea. Before the wolves gave the Qamerians their cruelty. Before the river Arek dried in its bed. Before the Iya held their first secret in their hearts. Before the Tyshe Mountains yielded their teeth. Before the first lotus bloomed on the Silver Lake. 
 
When all the earth was fat and fertile and the power used to form land and sea still glowed hot. I was born then, before the earth had cooled. The remnants of the spells spun still glistened on the wind. It gave wings to lizards and made fish crawl on land. It made the boughs of the trees bend down to meet the outstretched hand. 
 
Time and time again my mother told me the story which was the source of my great misery. To her, it was the source of her joy. It brought light to her earth colored eyes. It burned in my mind like a brand. 
 
One day, she used to say, as a child, still awkward of leg, still round of face, pot belly, wispy hair, words like a bird clamoring in the morning, I went unwatched. Away I wandered, fat feet padding against the hot earth. I wandered away from the safety of women and fell down a sharp cliff, tumbled down, rocks and stones meeting my body, breaking it. I cried out and all the woman came to find me, now they wondered where I was. They found me, broken, bleeding. My mama ran to me and wailed, cradling me in her arms. She cried out and wished I would be whole and not die, that no harm would come to her child. 
 
In her arms, my mother told me, she felt my bones shift and knit. My skin came together before the eyes of all the women. My chest rose as my mouth drew in air. All the woman cowered. They cried out praise for what they saw, what had happened. My mother had wished and it had come to pass. And so my mother became revered by the other women.
 
I grew older, raised within the shelters of my mother and the other women, meeting companies of men when the time came. Seasons would pass and children would be born. Other children grew sick, got hurt, and died. I did not. As a young woman, after my first blood, I was bitten by a snake known to be poisonous. The pain of the bite made me cry. The fevers wracked my body and my foot swelled, green and purple trails of poison and sick blood writing under my tight, sweating skin. But eventually the fever broke. The swelling went down. My skin returned to its normal color, sand licked by the sun's fiery tongue. I lived. My mother was given a headdress of beads and feathers and cloak of white fur. I was made the wayfarer of our clan. I went into places first. Dark, unfamiliar, peopled with clans unknown to us, with different ways. I went in with my knife and my spear and as I did not fear death, all things ran at my approach. The leaders of other people met with me first and I made a way for my people across the land.
 
My mother told me the story till the day she died, her skin wrinkled and brown like the pit of a sunfruit, her hair faded to bone bleached white, her teeth cracked and yellowed. When we buried her with her headdress and cloak, it never occurred to me I might want to join her in death, join my friends and enemies in whatever lay beyond this life.
 
The story of how I came to live was one thing in my mind; however, the facts of the story did not keep it from changing in the mouths and minds of others. I was given my own headdress of feathers and my own cloak. I kept my spear and took on the staff as my authority grew. My name became great and as my life stretched on, I changed and noticed how things changed around me. Eventually the people living in my shelters were not like the ones I grew up with. There was less magic in the land and the magic that was there, the people could not see, could not call to it. When people asked for things, the things no longer came readily. Magic came to be a word, and stories became legends as time stretched. My own story became one of magic and legend, something different altogether, different from a little girl dying at the bottom of a cliff and a mother's grief.
 
People gave things to me. They asked things of me with their hands full of gifts. They called out to anyone who would hear, who would answer.
 
I answered. I could feel the cooling of the earth but still understood its warmth.  I could still read the old language, feel the old magic in the warm winds. It was not my first language but I understood it, more than they, and so they wondered at my craft, cowered at my ability. Those who could hear the old magic seldom understood. They would tell me what the earth had told them and I would tell them what it meant. And I could not die.
 
So people gathered around me and they all became my people. I settled them in a fertile plain surrounded by hills rich in ore. They planted fields and brewed beer. My tent became a vast temple built of stone. I sat in the dark, on my throne made of wood, inlaid with stones and metal they pulled out of the earth with their hands and their tools. They gave me their riches from the earth and their fields. They asked for things and I gave them. They asked for rain and I called the clouds up from the Bawben Sea. They asked for health for themselves and their livestock and I charmed the illnesses from their bodies. They asked for peace and I had their enemies slay each other.
 
Every day, I was given their desires. Their wishes, their wants, their invocations all pressed against me like fingers. Fat, and wet, raking against my skin, pushing into my muscle, their jagged claws tearing into me bit by bit. They came to me because they needed me and I answered because I needed them. Without them, I had no one. So I sat on my throne of metal, drawing my robes around me and seeing to their desires. It was how I kept them near.
 
Other people, jealous people, came to try and destroy me, but they could not. They drew my blood many times over but never could I die, the wish of my mother surging through my bones. I would laugh like a child and grab them by their necks. I tore out their throats while they still lived. If they managed to escape, my people would find them and I would slay them in the way they wished to kill me, but slower. Crueler. Their desire to live drove my knives deeper, made them sharper.
 
Years passed. Generations. The village became a town, became a city, became a nation. The tents of old became spires of black and white stone. The roads were wide and paved with colorful stones, leading to glorious markets, luxurious homes and perfumed squares where children laughed. Boats with black and white sails left the harbor and strange boats docked, the languages of many people gibbering in the streets.  My temple loomed over the great city and its prosperity. Still, with all they brought forth with their own hands, they called upon me, asked me for rain and health and safety from their enemies, nations jealous of their works. 
 
The cries of my people grated upon on me, made me weary. Eventually their success became so great the jealousy of other nations became hate and hate became action. Another nation, a more powerful people rallied their armies, sharpened their swords. I sat in my temple as my people were all slaughtered, enslaved, driven away from their land as the armies surged through it like a summer flood. I hardened my heart against their pleas for help. 
 
I sat on my throne, still, like a stone, not fearing for my own life. I crawled into my bed, a box made of stone, smooth, dark stones strewn across the bottom. It reminded me of when I was a child and had fallen to my death, the rocks which had killed me. I covered my stone bed with a stone lid and sealed it, closing out the sounds of fires and screams. Within the stone walls I still heard the cries of the people, asking to be spared, for protection. Eventually the cries melted away to weeping, only to be replaced by the monotonous footsteps of approaching soldiers. I lay there in the dark and felt myself be lifted up and carried away. Tribute for a foreign king who had heard my name, heard my names. I heard the grunts of the soldiers carrying me, and their wishes. They just wanted to go home. 
 
I was presented to the king. The seal to my bed could not be lifted so they left me in the temple with other spoils of war. I lay in wait, listening, thinking. The king put out a proclamation: any person who could lift the lid of my bed would be rewarded. I laughed at his words within the stone chamber. 
 
In the dark, within the prison I made for myself, I thought. I thought about the people I had come from, all dead. The people I had abandoned, dead. Why had I allowed it? I lay in the dark and thought about the act which had made me what I was. I thought about those who had made the world and left so much raw energy there to wreak havoc. I wondered if there were others like me, made of flesh and blood and old magic, power from beyond our dirts and our waters. 
 
I thought about the desire of my mother, my mama. The light and darkness I brought to her eyes. Her body, melted away to time in a grave no longer marked. I thought of the wishes of people. Of how a desire felt, hungry and strong but incorporeal till I reached out with a steady hand and wove it into reality. I thought of my own desire. To not be alone, at first. I had satisfied that and there I was, alone in my bed, those outside calling it the tomb of a deity. They thought they had taken me from my home. I laughed at their foolishness within the stone walls. I felt the fear of those around me who heard it. And I heard the wishes of those who wished I would rise from my bed, not dead but sleeping. They wondered what I would do when I awoke.
 
I waited until the stars above were stars of importance, heralding something great. I waited and felt the world turn under me, hearing the sky creak as those shining specks, those gods fleeing the earth warned the people with their points of light, drew the people to the temple with auspicious signals. 
 
The music played, the incense burned, the priests shook out their robes and prayed. I laughed within my resting place and broke the lid of what they thought was a coffin. It cracked and slid off, the stench of an unknown land spreading through the temple. I rose from the stone coffer, still dressed in my fine robes, yellow silks dripping over my gaunt frame, beads in my hair, hate on my lips. I stepped out of the coffer and drank in the gasps of awe from those who watched me. The priests' mouths were vacant abysses of shock. Their prayers did not keep me back for I was not what they thought I was. I was just like them but old and tired and angry. I killed all the priests in the temple. I drank in their desire to live like cool, crisp water as their hot, thick blood spread over the stones.
 
These new people fashioned a lavish throne for me, setting it upon their highest hill so I could gaze down upon the world. Day after day, I stared out at where they kept their dead, wondering how I might join them. Few understood my words, old as my tongues were, so I sat in quiet, able to speak with a chosen few who became my priestesses. I rallied the people to war and had them bring back every book of power they could find, new magic and old, wresting them from the hands of powerful people with violence. I sent caravans of scouts to map the world, to find places of power, where old magic and new had pooled. I read the books in the dark, facing the cemeteries. In an old scroll, written in the blood of animal sacrifices and bound in the skin of women I found something. A place within the earth I could ask my question and be answered. A place I would be understood.
 
I acquired thirteen young people, each born on the full moon of each month and brought them to the place. I ignored their cries in the night, their sobs. Not one of them asked me to spare them with their mouths. They knew to speak such words was useless. When I raised the bone knife over each one, I saw it in their eyes, that they would have me stay my hand. I knelt in the power of their hot blood as it drained, as they wished to live, their desire blending with mine as I sent my question into the earth. In their blood and gore I danced and prayed, singing in the old tongue, asking how I could die. 
 
The answer came on the wind. “By a mother's hand made, by a mother's hand undone.”
 
I returned to my throne, the answer in my grasp. I ordered the generals to make war on neighboring countries in my name, to incite them to hate me. I put those words given to me, that which would be my undoing, into the prayers the people said, in their praises to me. I had the idols of other nations brought to the temple and destroyed, their priests and priestesses and shamans and seers slaughtered. I mixed the ashes of their mother goddesses into my wine and drank them. 
 
They sent their heroes. Great warriors, accomplished fighters, seasoned soldiers. All of them traveled to my temple. Some of them even arrived. They left their lovers and children and parents behind, bringing their anger and their wish for me to die with them. I felt the cold steel of their weapons in my dried flesh. I felt their bones break in my hands as I crushed them. I let their bodies rot on the steps of the temple. I mocked them and sent out dread callers to humiliate them. I told them to send their women, as all their men were pathetic. 
 
They began to attack me in number. I would find myself surrounded by all manners of violent people. Sword, spear, poison. In the hands of men, they did nothing so I killed them. I sent my armies out again and again and again, stretching them out across the land so the people would grow angry with me. Perhaps one of their mothers would draw against me. I told them to kill the children of the villages and towns and cities first, in front of their parents. More men came. They left their wives at home, to bake their bread with tears, to die when my armies reached their hovels.
 
The people were destitute. All the lands around me were inhabited by the husks of humans. They just wanted peace, for the wind to not reek of the dead, for the night to be quiet and not full of screams. They ate each other for food, as the fields were abandoned for war, the animals fled or slaughtered long ago. I only wanted one thing. I thought of my mother in her grave, piled high with honors. I thought of my own body, dried up, tired. Tired from the stretch of time. Tired from wanting something so much. Tired of being denied. I sat on my throne and wanted to die with all of my being, old as it was.
 
And then she came. 
 
I heard about her through the whispers of the people. A woman was coming, from the far grasslands of the Plains of Qamer. She had bones in her hair, some said. Others said she rode a wolf. All spoke of her spear, long and deadly, its blade as long as her leg. They spoke of the child she had left behind, how she had pulled it from her breast, still nursing, and handed her over to her sister, telling her clan to run east, while she ran west towards the dread city. They whispered of the things she had slain on her journeys, monsters old and monsters new, rulers and wizards who had dared stand in her way. The closer she drew, the louder the whispers grew. I sat on my throne and waited. 
 
She entered my throne room alone, her spear already dripping with blood. Her armor was well used, her skin dusty with travel and hard living. Her eyes were bright, the color of the first skies I saw as a child, dark and full of power, flashes of color shining through. She smelled like mother's milk wrapped in a hundred days of travel. Her hands shook on her spear.
 
I waved the door close with a gnarled hand, the sound of it closing making her jump. I drew myself up on my throne and leaned forward, staring at her. “Who is this, that would enter the throne room of She Who Has Been Forever, The Destructress of All Who Oppose Her, Who Swims In Blood and Fears No Man with a weapon? Who dares to threaten they who sees you as a doti bug, to be crushed underfoot before you begin your whining? Speak, that I may laugh your name when you are dead.”
 
“I am Ashuqa of the Green Plains, first among the children of Shauveh, wife of  Baq, mother of Busqa. I come to kill you.”
 
“Many have tried and failed,” I purred, rising from my throne. She stood fast, knuckles whitening on her spear as I drew power around me, whirls of shimmering color snaking across the floor. “What makes you think you, a pathetic woman, reeking of milk and dry grass, could ever subdue me. I have been since before your people crawled from the caves and cried to see the cruel stars. You are nothing to me. I shall destroy you.”
 
“I will kill you, there is nothing else I want,” she shouted, her voice echoing in the marble hall.
 
“You are a liar,” I growled. I drew closer to her, pulling power from those who waited outside, their breaths drawn as they anticipated the outcome. “You want to go home to your family, to your mewling whelp who cries out for you now.” I watched her eyes shine, heard the thump of her heart in her chest. I laughed, a dry, croaking sound. “When you fail to kill me, I shall torture you till the Sun devours the earth. I will find your babe and devour it before you. I will rip out your womb and feed on your flesh till-”
 
“Enough, witch!” she screamed, and my magic flared with her desire to kill me. “I shall kill you this night!” She rushed forward, drawing back her blade, her battle cry rich with human frustration and anger. 
 
I resisted. It would not do to have her kill me outright, though I longed for it. She had come so far. Her anger was so great. For the sake of her story, for her own immortality which would exist in the words people would pass around about her, I resisted. I pushed back her blows. I sent her sprawling across the floor. Blood, red and fresh bubbled from wounds I inflicted on her. Still she pushed on. Her desire to kill me turned to need. Her gleaming blade drew closer, archs of silver singing in the air.
 
It came. Her blade sunk into me. Sharp, cold metal pushed past papery thin skin and brittle bones. Black blood spurted. My blood. I stared into her eyes, my shaking hands grasping at the blade. Ashuqa pushed the blade in deeper. The sharp edge sliced into the skin and muscles of my fingers, grated against the bone. I was no stranger to pain but this was different. A pain there was no comfort for, sharp and draining. 
 
I felt my life flicker in the wind of her rage. She drove the blade in deeper, to the hilt, scraping past spine and withered organs, through my back. I writhed around the blade, unable to stop. The magic which had been keeping me alive all these spans of time began to unravel and fall loose, leaving me exposed, naked. I screamed in fear, in pain. I remembered being at the bottom of the ravine. The rocks and dirt, my broken and torn body. I remembered crying out for my mother, feeling my tiny life slip away. I felt small again, and scared. Ashuqa must have seen it in my eyes. 
 
Ashuqa drew back her blade. I fell to my knees, the hard floor adding to the torment of my dying body. The hapless spell my mother had spun with desperate intention shredded around me, sending out licks of fire, blasts of magic. They wracked the air, shook the earth. Ashuqa stepped back as the stones of the temple quaked. “Go,” I rasped, my last words on the earth. She regarded me for a moment before she went, running to dodge debris falling from the ceiling, the edifice groaning as I sat there, dying. I saw her escape through the door to the throne room, the doors flung open with my defeat.
 
Below me the earth rumbled. Cracks in the temple walls popped. The stones which made up the temple fell, striking my wasting form. They crushed my bones. As the last of the spell dissolved and entered the world, my fear subsided. I smiled in the oncoming dark, the pain of life melting as the relief of death approached. 
 
It was Ashuqa's turn to live on in story, which would become legend and then myth. 
 
Now, I could rest.
